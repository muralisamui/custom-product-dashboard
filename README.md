   - Client-side pagination for better UX
   - Optimized re-renders using proper state management
   - Lazy-loaded modals

2. **Code Organization**
   - Modular component architecture
   - Custom hooks for business logic
   - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
   - Separation of concerns (components, hooks, store)

3. **State Management**
   - Zustand for lightweight global state
   - React Query for server state management
   - Local component state for UI-specific states

4. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Responsive design

   - Accessible components
